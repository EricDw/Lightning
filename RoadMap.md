# Roadmap

The purpose of this document is to record a highlevel overview of the features that need to be completed.

## Features

### Onboarding

Provide the user with a way to create and, or, login into a account secured by
federated authentication algorithms.

### Transaction Management

This will be a top level destination in the application.

C.R.U.D. and Search operations for Transactions will be performed here.

#### Transaction Division

Provide the user with a way to divide the cost of a single transaction accross
Tags

### Budget Management

### Current Monthly Overiew

This will ultimately become the Home Screen.

The goal here is to elegantly, and preferably in one screen, display the status of the following items:

1. Budgets set for the month
2. Amounts spent for each Tag
3. Transactions for the month

### Settings

Provide the user a place to manage all the various application settings.
